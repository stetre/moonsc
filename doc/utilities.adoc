[[set_env_template]]
* *set_env_template*(_env_) +
[small]#Sets the template for the Lua environments dedicated to sessions (e.g. for sandboxing). +
By default, the template environment is a shallow copy of the main environment (_$$_ENV$$_)
as it is when the MoonSC module is loaded with
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-require[require]().#

[[now]]
* _timestamp_ = *now*( ) +
[small]#Returns the current system time, in seconds. The system time is relative to
an unspecified point in the past, that depends on the underlying function used to
retrieve time from the operating system. +
Session can access this same function from their dedicated $$_ENV$$, where it is
global and defined as _Now(&nbsp;)_.#

[[since]]
* _dt_ = *since*(_timestamp_) +
[small]#Returns the time elapsed from the point in time given by _timestamp_. +
Session can access this same function from their dedicated $$_ENV$$, where it is
global and defined as _Since(&nbsp;)_.#

[[tostring]]
* _string_ = *tostring*(_sessionid_) +
[small]#Returns a printable description of the statechart for the session identified
by _sessionid_, with all its elements arranged in a tree, and their attributes and values.#
